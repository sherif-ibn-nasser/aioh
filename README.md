![Aioh Editor Logo](assets/aioh-logo.svg)

<div> A high-performance text editor with hardware-accelerated rendering, built for modern developers and optimized for smooth and efficient text editing workflows. </div>

## Overview

Aioh is a modern, versatile text editor designed for developers who demand high performance and flexibility. Leveraging
OpenGL for rendering, Aioh delivers smooth scrolling, crisp text rendering, and exceptional performance, even when
working with large files.

While Aioh provides excellent support for Right-to-Left (RTL) languages, including Arabic, it is not limited to a
specific language or programming environment. The editor includes specialized features for Nazm Programming Language,
but it is designed as a general-purpose editor for a wide range of use cases.
